# 8 Puzzle Solver
Authors: [Emily Hix](https://github.com/emilyhix) and [Sabaipon Phimmala](https://github.com/bphimmala)

8 puzzle solver utilizing the A* search algorithm and various heuristics. The implementation is intentionally modular and features an object-oriented design.

 ## What We Learned
- Implementation of a generalized search algorithm
- Impact and effectiveness of heuristics in an AI search problem (Uniform Cost Search, Misplaced Tile, Euclidean Distance)
- Object-oriented representation of problem state
